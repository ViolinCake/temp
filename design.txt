///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
class Sensors should have the interfaces for different sensors 

each class sensor should have its own reading generator

class Diagstrategy should the interfaces for different sensor strategies

each SensorDiagStrategy class should have the check strategy for the sensor reading
probably using an analyze function
based on the checks, the SensorDiagStrategy should send a request to the ECU tells it to 
perform a specific task "slowdown, break, alarm,...etc"

class Diagnostics should process all the sensors readings by looping on all the checks of the
sensors strategies analyses
it will loop on a vector of pointers to sensor class

class ECU shall have the actuall functions that performs the requests came from the sensor strategy
like lowering speed or hitting the break or raising alarm 

class logger shall log all readings and status of each class using singletone design pattern
for single instance
